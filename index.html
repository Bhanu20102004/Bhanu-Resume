    <p class="project1">Finding Nearby Ambulance</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Engineered a ReactJS web application that significantly improved emergency response by providing real-time
            information on nearby ambulances and hospitals.</li>
        <li>Achieved a remarkable 40% reduction in average response time by revolutionizing the way emergency services are
            accessed.
            </li>
        <li>Developed two distinct modules within the website: the first module offers detailed information on ambulance
            services, and the second module provides insights into hospital services.</li>
        <li>Applied the "Greatest Circle Distance" formula to accurately identify and present details of the nearest ambulance
            and hospital services, showcasing a practical application of geographical calculations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="project2">Campus Bites</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The web application introduces a flexible platform that prioritizes secure payments through a unique student authorization mechanism. </li>
        <li>This system not only simplifies the payment process but also mitigates issues related to network errors during transactions.</li>
        <li>By ensuring that every transaction is securely authenticated, we provide a robust solution to the prevalent problems faced in college canteen payments.</li>
        <li>Additionally, the web application enables students to pre-order their meals and pre-pay their bills, thus avoiding delays and enhancing the overall efficiency of the canteen service. </li>
